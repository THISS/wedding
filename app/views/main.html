      <p>Hi i'm Brenton,<br />I was born in Sydney, NSW, Australia.
        I moved around a bit while growing up. I have lived in Sydney New South Wales, Sunshine Coast Queensland,
        as well as Gold Coast Queensland. Once I finished my schooling on the Gold Coast in 2005 it took
        me 6 months to make my way back down to Sydney.
      </p>
      <p>I came out from Australia in 2009 to do a ski season in Lake Louise Alberta. A few of the boys
        who I lived and worked with decided to come out to Penticton, British Columbia for the Summer of 2010.
      </p>
      <p>I met Kim in the first week of being in town, at the local watering hole "The Parrot". The boys
        and I were throwin' down a few quarters in some drinking games when I decided in my infinite wisdom
        to venture over and slur my way to victory by getting Kim and her friends to play quarters.
      </p>
      <p>
        - I won.
      </p>
      <p> <-- I like her a lot</p>
